# Linear Solutions

This is a repository of small, agile, purpose-built solutions created by the Linear Solutions Engineering team. These are intended as starting points to help you bring more functionality to your Linear Workspace and not as full integrations or features. Please use these knowing that they are generally experimental in nature and may have bugs or unintended impacts on your Workspace.
