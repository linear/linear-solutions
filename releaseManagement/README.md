# Linear Release Management

Application that automatically manages Linear issue labels when GitHub releases are created. This app processes GitHub release webhooks to find Linear issues and apply release labels.

## üöÄ How It Works

### **Core Workflow**
1. **GitHub Release Webhook**: When a new release is created in GitHub, it triggers a webhook to this application
2. **Smart Event Filtering**: Only processes major release states, automatically ignoring edits and deletions
3. **Issue Detection**: The app scans commits, pull requests, and branch names to find Linear issue keys
4. **Linear Integration**: Creates release labels and applies them to found issues

### **Smart Linear Issue Key Detection**
The app uses a sophisticated approach to find Linear issue keys:

- **Exact Team Key Matching**: First tries to match against actual Linear team keys for maximum accuracy
- **Dynamic Regex Fallback**: Falls back to intelligent regex patterns based on team key lengths
- **Case-Insensitive**: Handles variations in key casing (e.g., "ENG-123" vs "eng-123")
- **Branch Name Search**: Searches Linear for issues associated with Git branch names

### **API Optimization**
- **Single GitHub API Call**: Fetches commits once and reuses them across all operations
- **Batch Linear Operations**: Groups Linear API calls to reduce rate limiting
- **Limited Branch Processing**: Processes max 50 commits for branch info to prevent excessive API calls
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and logs total API calls made during processing
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Adds delays between batches to respect API limits

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before setting up this application, you'll need:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **GitHub Repository** with releases enabled
- **Linear Account** with API access


**Windows Users**: The `setup-with-ngrok.bat` file will handle most of the setup automatically.

**Mac/Linux Users**: The `setup-with-ngrok.sh` script will handle most of the setup automatically.

## üìã Setup Instructions

### **Quick Start (All Platforms)**

Clone this repository.

**Windows Users:**
1. **Double-click** `setup-with-ngrok.bat`
2. Follow the prompts to configure your environment
3. The script will handle dependency installation and server startup
4. Use the displayed ngrok URL for your GitHub webhook

**Mac/Linux Users:**
1. **Run** `./setup-with-ngrok.sh` in your terminal
2. Follow the prompts to configure your environment
3. The script will handle dependency installation and server startup
4. Use the displayed ngrok URL for your GitHub webhook

### **Manual Setup**

### **Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Linear-Release-Management
npm install
```

### **Step 2: Environment Configuration**

Copy the `env.example` file to `.env` in the root directory and update the values:

```bash
# Copy the template file
copy env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file with your actual API keys and configuration.

#### **Getting Your API Keys:**

**GitHub Token:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Copy the token to `GITHUB_TOKEN`

**Linear API Key:**
1. Go to Linear Settings ‚Üí API
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key to `LINEAR_API_KEY`

### **Step 3: Build the Application**

```bash
npm run build
```

### **Step 4: Start the Server**

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## üîó Webhook Configuration

### **GitHub Webhook Setup**

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Click "Add webhook"
4. Configure the webhook:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://your-domain.com/github-webhook`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Events**: Select "Releases only"
   - **Active**: Checked

**Note**: The app only processes releases when they are created, prereleased, published, released, or unpublished. It automatically ignores release edits and deletions to prevent unnecessary processing.

### **Quick Setup with ngrok (Windows)**

Use the provided `setup-with-ngrok.bat` file for easy setup:

1. **Double-click** `setup-with-ngrok.bat` to run it
2. The script will:
   - Install dependencies if needed
   - Start the server
   - Launch ngrok to expose your local server
   - Display the webhook URL to use

**Manual ngrok Setup (Alternative):**

If you prefer to set up ngrok manually:

```bash
# Install ngrok globally
npm install -g ngrok

# Start your server
npm start

# In another terminal, expose your local server
ngrok http 3000
```

Use the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) as your webhook payload URL.

## üß™ Testing

### **Health Check**
Test if your server is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "linear": "configured",
    "github": "configured"
  }
}
```

### **Test Release**
1. Create a new release in your GitHub repository
2. Check the server logs for processing information
3. Verify the Linear label was created and applied

## üìä What Happens During Processing

When a release webhook is received:

1. **Immediate Response**: Server responds to GitHub within seconds
2. **Background Processing**: Release processing continues asynchronously
3. **Commit Analysis**: Scans all commits between releases for Linear keys
4. **PR Analysis**: Extracts PR information and scans for Linear keys
5. **Branch Search**: Queries Linear for issues associated with branch names
6. **Label Application**: Creates Linear label and applies to all found issues

## üîß Configuration Options

### **Environment Variables**

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | - | GitHub personal access token |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | Yes | - | Linear App Token |
| `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN` | Yes | - | Ngrok Authtoken |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Yes | - | You define this, authentication for the webhook |
| `NGROK_DOMAIN` | No | - | Optional if you already have an Ngrok URL, otherwise this app will create one |
| `PORT` | No | 3000 | Defaults to 3000, change if you prefer something else |

### **Performance Tuning**

The app includes several performance optimizations:

- **Batch Size**: Linear API calls are batched in groups of 10
- **Rate Limiting**: 100ms delays between batches to respect API limits
- **Commit Limits**: Maximum 50 commits processed for branch information
- **Parallel Processing**: Commits and PRs are scanned simultaneously
- **API Call Tracking**: Monitors and logs total API calls for performance analysis
- **Smart Event Filtering**: Ignoring release events that are edits/deletions

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Linear API Errors:**
- Verify your `LINEAR_API_KEY` is correct
- Check if the key has necessary permissions
- Ensure your Linear organization allows API access

**GitHub Webhook Issues:**
- Verify the webhook URL is accessible
- Check webhook delivery logs in GitHub
- Ensure the repository has releases enabled

**No Issues Found:**
- Check if commits contain Linear issue keys
- Verify team keys are being retrieved from Linear
- Review server logs for detailed processing information
- App ignores edits/deletions release events

### **Log Analysis**

The app provides detailed logging for debugging:

- **Team Key Detection**: Shows how many Linear team keys were found
